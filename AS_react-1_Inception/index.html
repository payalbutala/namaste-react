        <b>What is CDN?</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            CDN : A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is geographically dispersed
            network of servers and data centers. The goal of CDN is to
            facilitate increased web performance and high availability by
            locating web content copies closer to end users.
          </li>
          <li>
            CDN servers store or cache copies of varies web content subsets from
            a host server, such as applications, video, audio, images and HTML
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            CDN by bringing web content nearer to end-users, allows website
            publishers to control bandwidth consumption, reduce load times, and
            provide enhanced performance.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What is crossorigin?</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            CORS - stands for cross-origin resource sharing. It helps in which
            one webpage requests for another domain for fetching out resources
            like audio, video, script etc. from third party server without
            leaking their credentials information.
          </li>
          <li>
            It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to
            determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        How browser understand Javascript? Javascript Virtual Machine.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Browser like chrome decode Javascript using a compiler like V8
            Engine.
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser has in-built Javascript engine that is responsible for
            interpreting and exeuting javascript code. When we visit web page
            that ocntains javascript, the browser downloads the Javascript code
            and passes it to the engine, which then reads the code and executes
            it.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Get React into Project</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using CDN Links - react in included in project, so browser
            understand React as we injected in project.
          </li>
          <li>react : this includes core code of React.</li>
          <li>
            react-dom :this is useful for DOM operations. Bridge between react
            code & DOM.
          </li>
          <li>
            React works on mobile - React-Native : so they use react code file.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            React.createElement : takes 3 arguments. (element (h1), object -
            where it gives attributes to tag (id: "header"), content("Hello") of
            h1 tag OR 1 child or Array of children (should have unique key) (can
            be multiple child1,2,..)), this is in "react core"
          </li>
          <li>
            ReactDOM.createRoot :
            React.craeteRoot(document.getElementById("root")), this is in
            "react-dom"
          </li>
          <li>
            root.render(heading) : It is adding container in root tag, if
            something already exists it will overwrite.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        JS - order of file matters? - YES, All files should be sequence due to
        dependency of 2nd file on 1st.
      </li>
      <li>dev vs production links?</li>
      <li>
        React is library : we can update small portion of code using react. It
        independently update small portion of code.
      </li>
      <li>jsx : React is only written only using .JSX</li>
    </ul>
