    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>
          Monolith Architecture: Monolith means composed all in one piece. The
          Monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application
          in which different components combined into a single program from a
          single platform.
        </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1 Project = API's written + UI + Authentication Code + Database
            Connectivity + Sending SMS
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite having different components/modules/services, the
            application is built and deployed as one Application for all
            platforms (i.e. desktop, mobile and tablet)
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>MicroService Architecture:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We have different service for different job. Like: Backend Service,
            UI Service, UI Project, Authentication Service, Service connects to
            Database, Service to send SMS, Service for Email notifications.
          </li>
          <li>Theses all services combines together forms a big app.</li>
          <li>
            We have all as separate project => <b>Separation of Concerns</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >It follows Single responsibility Principle where each service has
              its own job, no-one interfere in it.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >How these services interact with each other to work application
              as a single project? =>
            </b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                They make call to different port/url. Like UI call an API.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>How it deploy?</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Each service run on their own specific port. We deploy each
                service on different port.
              </li>
              <li>
                All ports can be mapped to domain name. API -> abc.com/api, UI
                -> abc.com
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          How React Application, make connection with different microservices.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>How UI Application, fetch data from backend?</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Approach 1 : As soon as page loads - make an API call, when we get
            data, render it into UI. If API call take 500ms, page will wait &
            after 500ms it will load UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            Approach 2 : As soon as page loads - we will render UI then make API
            call, after completion of API data fetch, We will rerender
            <b>(React render cycle is very fast.)</b> our application with new
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            In React, we will always using Approach 2, better Approach with
            better UX.
            <ol>
              <li>No feel like page frozen.</li>
              <li>Atleast we see UI skeleton.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
