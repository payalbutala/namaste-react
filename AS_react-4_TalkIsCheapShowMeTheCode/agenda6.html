    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>
          Monolith Architecture: Monolith means composed all in one piece. The
          Monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application
          in which different components combined into a single program from a
          single platform.
        </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1 Project = API's written + UI + Authentication Code + Database
            Connectivity + Sending SMS
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite having different components/modules/services, the
            application is built and deployed as one Application for all
            platforms (i.e. desktop, mobile and tablet)
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>MicroService Architecture:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We have different service for different job. Like: Backend Service,
            UI Service, UI Project, Authentication Service, Service connects to
            Database, Service to send SMS, Service for Email notifications.
          </li>
          <li>Theses all services combines together forms a big app.</li>
          <li>
            We have all as separate project => <b>Separation of Concerns</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >It follows Single responsibility Principle where each service has
              its own job, no-one interfere in it.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >How these services interact with each other to work application
              as a single project? =>
            </b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                They make call to different port/url. Like UI call an API.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>How it deploy?</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Each service run on their own specific port. We deploy each
                service on different port.
              </li>
              <li>
                All ports can be mapped to domain name. API -> abc.com/api, UI
                -> abc.com
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          How React Application, make connection with different microservices.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>How UI Application, fetch data from backend?</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Approach 1</b> : As soon as page loads - make an API call, when
            we get data, render it into UI. If API call take 500ms, page will
            wait & after 500ms it will load UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Approach 2</b> : As soon as page loads - we will render UI then
            make API call, after completion of API data fetch, We will rerender
            <b>(React render cycle is very fast.)</b> our application with new
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            In React, we will always using Approach 2, better Approach with
            better UX.
            <ol>
              <li>No feel like page frozen.</li>
              <li>Atleast we see UI skeleton.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2 Approaches - how web app fetch data from backend.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1. When an App load - API call - Render in UI</li>
          <li>
            2. When an app load - Render UI - API Call - Re-Render UI with API
            data
            <b
              >(If approach 1 api call takes 500ms it will show blank page which
              is avodable here.)</b
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          useEffect : normal React hook. hook = Nothing but simply a normal
          Javascript Function, it has its normal use case.
        </h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            useEffect has 2 arguments => arraw callback function, dependency
            array
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >When will this useEffect callback function will be called? =>
              after component renders. If you want to do something after
              component render, use useEffect.</b

        <h4>fetch</h4>
        <p>
          super power given by browser, JS Engine has, it will fetch data from
          API. It will return promise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>cors error</h4>
        <p>
          browser is blocking to access/call an API from 1 origin to different
          origin.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>optional chaining</h4>
        is to add => ?
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <h4>Shimmer UI</h4>
          Resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly
          the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Conditional Rendering : render UI based on condition</h4>
        <p>
          // Conditional Rendering <br />
          if (listOfRestaurants.length === 0) { return <Shimmer />; }
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>State Variable</h4>
        <h2>
          Whenever state variable update, react triggers a reconciliation
          cycle(re-renders the component.)
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Whenever state variable will change React will re-render header
              component.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Able to update const variable because : it is calling complete
            component once again so next time variable is new variable.
          </li>
        </ol>
