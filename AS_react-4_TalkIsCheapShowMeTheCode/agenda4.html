    <h2>Agenda</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Plan your app - what to build?</li>
      <li>how will it look?</li>
      <li>
        Inline CSS won;t work how it works with plain HTML, but add style
        properties as javascript object.
        <ol>
          <li>const styleCard = { backgroundColor: "yellow", };</li>
          <li>[div className="res-card" style="{styleCard}"]</li>
          <li>
            [div className="res-card" style="{{backgroundColor: 'yellow'}}" ]
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>props = properties</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >When you want to dynamically pass some data to a component - you
              pass it as a prop.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            something which we can pass to components. Like passing some dynamic
            data to components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Props or Destructing on the fly => {ob1.key1, obj1.key2} = normal
            arguments to a function.
          </li>
          <li>props : returns an object</li>
          <li>you can pass as many props you wish too.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          Configure Driven UI : Controlling UI using Data/Config. Config comes
          from backend. Eg: At different places there are different options like
          different offers, different carousal,
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        Whenever we loop : Each item should has unique id/key. Why we need key?
        <ol>
          <li>
            When there are components are at same level, there should be unique
            id.
          </li>
          <li>
            As if new restaurant came, then react has to add it to some place,
            suppose 1st place. Then react will append at 1st place if we have
            given key.
          </li>
          <li>If key is not present - react has to render all cards again.</li>
          <li><b>React says - don't use index as unique key in loop.</b></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
