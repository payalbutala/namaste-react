    <h2>Agenda</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignite React App :</li>
      <li>
        npx parcel build index.html => Production code : should be optimized,
        minified, bundled, compressed And no comments, no console.log
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>npm</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            npm : node package manager is not full form of npm. There is not
            full form to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >npm : package manager, manage packages/dependencies which we
              install in system.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            It manages packages behind the scene. Takes care of package version
            in package.json.
          </li>
          <li>npm init => It will configure -y(it will skip many things).</li>
          <li>
            creates node_modules -> includes all dependencies in node_modules.
            so its like database for packages.json in which we added
            configuration=list of dependencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            We added parcel - which has many other dependencies which is why
            there are many files under node_modules = TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every folder in node_modules has -> package.json = TRANSITIVE
            DEPENDENCIES.
          </li>
          <li>NEVER push node_modules to git.</li>
          <li>
            ALWAYS push package & package-lock.json to git. As it maintains, has
            list of all dependencies we need. = We can recreate all node_modules
            so no need to push node_modules in .git.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>package.josn : Configuration for npm</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Why need package.json? :</li>
          <li>
            <b
              >It keep approx version of package installed vs package-lock has
              exact version.</b
            >
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>package-lock.json</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            it keep track of exact version of package/dependency which is
            installed -
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b
          >bundler (webpack, parcel, veet) : will helps to code optimized,
          minified, bundled, compressed And no comments, no console.log - It
          packages/bundles our code to ship to production.</b

            create-react-app : behind seen used webpack and babel to build code
          </li>
        </ol>

      <li>
        <b
          >parcel : has node package. npm install parcel OR npm install -D(dev

          <li>
            In general - 2 dependencies/packages : a. Dev - development 2.
            Normal - production.
          </li>
          <li>"parcel": "^2.12.0" => ^ is known as carot.</li>
          <li>
            ~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will automatically
            update you to all future patch versions that are
            backwards-compatible, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3
            will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 1.3.0.
          </li>
          <li>
            ^version “Compatible with version”, will automatically update you to
            all future minor/patch versions that are backwards-compatible,
            without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases
            from 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0.
          </li>
          <li>
            It has "integrity" in package-lock.json -> integrity has "Sha512" =
            It verify - whatever version I have in my machine it should be same
            version I deployed to production.

        <b>Ingite Our App</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            npm (only installs package), here we use command : npx(executing
            package) parcel index.html => source file/entry point of project,
            goes to index.html and build development build for our app. and host
            it to localhost (http://localhost:1234).
          </li>
          <li>
            npx parcel build index.html => all files after bundled goes to dist
            folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            remove ""main": "App.js"," from package.json else it will give error
            as conflict with above entry point, as parcel adds index.html is
            entry point.
          </li>
          <li>Parcel created server for us : creates source for us.</li>
          <li>npm install react : adding/installing react into package</li>
          <li>npm install react-dom : adding/installing react into package</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        import() React from "react"("react" : this refers to react in
        node_modules);
      </li>
      <li>
        <script src="./App.js"></script>
        => throwing error as @parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have
        imports or exports. so fix by adding <b>type="module"</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as you save changes it reflectes in page - done by
        parcel(bundler) : it caches code in .parcel-cache. It builds faster.
      </li>
